## Project Overview
Our primary objective is to identify neighborhoods in New York City that offer a serene living environment, characterized by low noise levels and abundant greenery. To this end, we analyze a diverse array of data sources, including Zillow's historical rent data, 311 urban complaints data from NYC Open Data, and the distribution of green spaces throughout the city. Our analysis is comprehensive, extending beyond the quest for tranquility and greenery to encompass a variety of urban complaints, rent prices, and an assessment of tree data. These datasets will be collectively utilized to pinpoint neighborhoods that meet the criteria of affordability and quality of living.


Certainly! Let's elaborate on each of the project goals to provide a more comprehensive and detailed overview that would significantly enhance the content for your README, aiming to contribute substantially to the documentation:

## Project Goals
1. Blending Affordability with Serenity

Our objective is not just to find quiet corners in New York City but to intertwine this tranquility with affordability. We strive to paint a detailed picture of each neighborhood, factoring in the cost of living, to ensure that the serene spaces we identify are not just peaceful but also financially accessible. This involves a deep dive into rental market trends, analyzing how prices fluctuate over time and space. Our goal is to provide a balanced narrative that resonates with the dreams of average New Yorkers â€“ a narrative where peaceful living does not come at a prohibitive cost.
2. Analyzing a Spectrum of Urban Complaints

Urban life comes with its unique set of challenges, and our project seeks to address these by scrutinizing a wide array of urban complaints. From the incessant honking of car horns to the less obvious issues like inadequate waste management, our analysis covers a broad spectrum. We intend to use this data to not only identify the quieter neighborhoods but also to understand the underlying causes of unrest in busier areas. This comprehensive analysis will equip potential residents with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their future neighborhoods, ensuring they know what to expect beyond the surface-level tranquility.
