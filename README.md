## Project Overview
Our primary objective is to identify neighborhoods in New York City that offer a serene living environment, characterized by low noise levels and abundant greenery. To this end, we analyze a diverse array of data sources, including Zillow's historical rent data, 311 urban complaints data from NYC Open Data, and the distribution of green spaces throughout the city. Our analysis is comprehensive, extending beyond the quest for tranquility and greenery to encompass a variety of urban complaints, rent prices, and an assessment of tree data. These datasets will be collectively utilized to pinpoint neighborhoods that meet the criteria of affordability and quality of living.
